I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab at Stanford University, USA, working under [Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/mykel-kochenderfer). My research interests include multi-agent systems, robust machine learning and decision-making under uncertainty. 

I was <b>awarded the 2019 CARS post-doctoral fellowship</b> by the [Center of Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS)](https://cars.stanford.edu/). Before joining Stanford, I was a PhD student at Vanderbilt University's Computational Economics Research Lab under [Prof. Eugene Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/). My thesis was <b>nominated for the Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award 2020</b>.  

I am particularly intersted in applying AI to real-world problems, especially ones that have societal impacts. Much of my disseration focussed on using AI to aid proactive emergency response. My current work focusses on designing decentralized decision-making systems for emergency response, and also trying to understand how to tackle wildfires and heatwaves. This quarter, I am one of the mentors for [Stanford's CS+Social Good Impact Lab](https://cs4good.com/), helping undergraduate students use AI for social good. I am also one of the members of Stanford's energy committee, working on using predictive models to understand energy needs on campus.
