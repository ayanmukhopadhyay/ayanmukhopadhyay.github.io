Hi, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab at Stanford University, USA, working under Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer. I was awarded the 2019 CARS Post-doctoral fellowship by the Center of Automotive Research at Stanford. Before joining Stanford, I was a PhD student at Vanderbilt University's Computational Economics Research Lab under Prof. Eugene Vorobeychik. Broadly, I work on multi-agent systems, robust machine learning and decision-making under uncertainty. 

I am particularly intersted in applying AI to real-world problem, especially ones that have societal impacts. Much of my disseration focussed on using AI to predict crimes and accidents, and subsequently designing resource allocation and deployment models to aid emergency response. I am currently working on designing decentralized decision-making systems for emergency response, and also trying to understand how to tackle wildfires and heatwaves. This quarter, I am one of the mentors for Stanford's AI Impact Lab and I love to talk about using AI in the field. I am also one of the members of Stanford's energy committee, where I try to predict cooling loads in uncertain weather conditions using Machine Learning.
