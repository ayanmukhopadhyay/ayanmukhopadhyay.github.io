I am a research scientist and an adjunct assistant professor at the department of computer science at Vanderbilt University, USA. My research interests include multi-agent systems, robust machine learning, and decision-making under uncertainty. I am honored to be one of the recipients of the Google AI Impact Scholar Award (2021) for Social Good.

Prior to this, I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab at Stanford University, USA, working under [Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/mykel-kochenderfer). I was awarded the 2019 CARS post-doctoral fellowship by the [Center of Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS)](https://cars.stanford.edu/). Before joining Stanford, I was a Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt University's Computational Economics Research Lab under [Prof. Eugene Vorobeychik](https://vorobeychik.com/). My thesis was nominated for the Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award 2020.  

I am particularly interested in applying AI to real-world problems, especially ones that have societal impacts. Much of my dissertation focussed on using AI to aid proactive emergency response. My current work focuses on designing decentralized decision-making systems for emergency response, understanding how crowdsourced reports can be used to infer emergency scenarios, optimizing para-transit routing, trying to understand how to tackle wildfires and heatwaves, and designing deep learning methods for aiding conservation. At Stanford, I was one of the mentors for [Stanford's CS+Social Good Impact Lab](https://cs4good.com/), helping undergraduate students use AI for social good. My research is supported by Cisco, National Science Foundation, Google AI for Social Good, and Microsoft AI for Earth.

If you are interested in these research areas or want to explore AI for social good, feel free to reach out. I am happy to chat, learn, help, and collaborate!
