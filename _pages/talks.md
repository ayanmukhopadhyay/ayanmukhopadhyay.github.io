1. We gave a <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/tutorial_smartcomp21.pdf">tutorial on multi-agent emergency response systems</a> at IEEE <a href="https://www.smart-comp.info/tutorials.html">SmartComp 2021</a>. The videos of the talk are available <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ5EcK0kbWDzuxsqNRUGmcGYP4_7GnGAI">on youtube</a>.
  
2. I was one of the invited speakers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's workshop on emergency response. See the slides <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/talks/MultiAgentEmergency.pdf">here</a>.
  
3. I gave a talk at the Los Alamos National Lab's Seminar Series on "Multi-Agent Systems for Emergency Response." See the slides <a href="https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/talks/MultiAgentEmergency.pdf">here</a>.

4. I gave a tutorial on "Smart Emergency Response" at the NSF Doctoral Consortium on Computational Sustainability, 2020 (CompSust-DC) (Tutorial). See the talk here <a href="https://youtu.be/5OZszP4FTlw?t=386">here</a>.

5. I gave a talk on lessons and challenges learned while designing emergency response systems at the AAAI Fall Symposium 2020 - AI for Social Good. See the talk <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e7rdbeszb8pk9zh/AAAI_FSS.mov?dl=0">here</a>.

6. I gave a talk at the Utah Center for Data Science's Summer Seminar Series on the 19th of June about robust machine learning models and smart emergency response. See the poster <a href="http://datascience.utah.edu/assets/img/club_photos/SSS-2020-05.pdf">here</a>, and listen to the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIaj7szN5I&t=1143s">here</a>

7. I gave a talk about how robust incident prediction can combat poaching at the <a href="https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/148537">Cambridge Environmental Data Science Group's AI4ER Seminar Series</a> on the 30th of June. If you are interested in the intersection of data science and environment, listen to the talk <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l55yg3ozk3po1l9/AyanMukhopadhyay300620.mp4?dl=0">here</a>.

8. A recent [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IMxgb4a1No&feature=youtu.be) I gave at Stanford's CARS (Center of Automotive Research) Annual Symposium.

9. Our research was covered in an [article on smart cities](https://www.ft.com/content/140ae3f0-1b6f-11ea-81f0-0c253907d3e0) by Financial Times.

10. Our work was covered in the Government Technology Magazine as part of it's "MetroLab Innovation of the Month Series". Check out the article [here](https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Data-Drives-Down-Nashvilles-Emergency-Response-Times.html).

11. A relatively non-technical overview of my work from the AI for Social Good Workshop at AAAI's Spring Symposium 2017 can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96QExCTpBbI&t=51m0s).

12. Our work was showcased as part of the [Global City Teams Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/GCTC/event/gctc-expo-2017/exhibit/), a global smart city symposium. See the poster [here](http://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/postergctc.pdf).
