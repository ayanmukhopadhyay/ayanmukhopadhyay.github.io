<b>Robust Spatial-Temporal Incident Prediction</b> <br> 

Crimes like wildlife poaching and smuggling can be tackled by spatial-temporal incident forecasting. However, existing prediction methodologies fail to take an important issue in consideration -- agents that commit crimes can observe patrols and change their behavior. This project deals with modeling the interaction between existing off-the-shelf prediction algorithms and agents as a Stackelberg game, and designing patrol strategies that are robust to spatial shifts by agents.

<b>Emergency Response Management Pipelines for Smart Cities</b> <br> 

Emergency response management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities across the globe. First-responders are constrained by limited resources, and must attend to different types of incidents like traffic accidents, fires, crime, and distress calls. This project deals with creating spatial-temporal predictive models for accidents and crimes, and designing multi-agent approaches to emergency response. Our work has been showcased at multiple global smart city summits, covered in the government technology magazine and won the best paper award at ICLRâ€™s AI for Social Good Workshop. Read our [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04200) summarizing the research in this space in the last few decades.

I am also one of the creators of [<b>StatResp</b>](https://statresp.ai/), an integrated open-source toolchain of statistical methods to aid emergency response. Read more about the work [[here]](https://ayanmukhopadhyay.github.io/files/aisg_iclr19.pdf)


<b>Wildifire Spread Modeling</b> <br> 

I am currently working to understand how wildfires spread by using large-scale satelitte imagery. This involves learning how altitude, slope, vegetation type, temperature and other environmental covariates affect the spread of wildfires. Subsequently, we want to create agent-based fire suppression algorithms.


<b>Monarch Migration</b> <br> 

Every winter, thousands of monarch butterflies from Canada and United States migrate to a small group of forests in Mexico. Monarchs are increasingly being threatened by deforestation and climate change. I am interested in animal migrations in general, and currently working on designing approaches to automate the counting of monarch butterflies in clusters.
